# Object Detection with EfficientDet TFLite
This is a simple object detection demo that uses Tensorflow Lite. It takes an image as input and detects objects in it, drawing bounding boxes around them and labeling each object.

## Usage
- Create a virtual environment 
- Install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Pick the model version in model_choice = 3 (1 - 4).
- Run the script with python demo.py
The script will create an output image with the same name as the input image but with "_result_tflite" appended to it.
